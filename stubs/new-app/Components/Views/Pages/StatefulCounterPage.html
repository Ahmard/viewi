    <h1>Stateful Counter</h1>
    <div class="mui--text-dark mui--text-subhead">Unlike the regular counter, this one remembers its state for further
        use.</div>
    <div class="mui--text-dark mui--text-subhead">No matter how you change the count, it will keep it in reducer.</div>
    <div class="mui--text-dark mui--text-subhead">And foremore - you can use it in different places (share with another
        component for example) and the count
        will be the same.</div>
